# Upgrading Valetudo

If you're using Valetudo 2021.11.0 or later, you should be able to use its integrated updater functionality.
In addition, for some users it is not possible to get the latest firmware via the normal flash method.

Below are manual upgrading instructions for older versions:

## Upgrading Roborock Vacuums

### S5, V1 and S6

If you're using an S5 or V1, the recommended way to upgrade Valetudo is to flash a new image. This requires you to have SSH access to the robot.

1. Select the `Build for manual installation (requires SSH to install)` option in the [Dustbuilder](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/). You will then receive a link to a tar.gz archive by email.
2. Login to your robot via SSH:
```sh
ssh -i <something>.id_rsa -l root <ip.of.your.roborock>
```
3. Download the tar.gz file to the `/mnt/data` folder and extract it:
```sh
cd /mnt/data
wget <url to tar from dustbuilder>
tar xzf <file.tar.gz>
```
If you get some errors on this point while wget the tar.gz, it could be caused by ssl. You can try this:
```sh
cd /mnt/data
wget <url to tar from dustbuilder> --no-check-certificate
tar xzf <file.tar.gz>
```
4. The robot has two systems, you cannot update a system whilst it is in use. You will be in system A by default, allowing you to update system B. Update system B (from system A) then reboot into system B:
```sh
./install_b.sh
reboot
```
5. Reconnect to your robot via SSH. You'll now be in system B, allowing you to update system A. Update system A (from system B) then reboot back into system A for normal operation:
```sh
cd /mnt/data
./install_a.sh
rm -f <file.tar.gz> disk.img firmware.md5sum install_a.sh install_b.sh
reboot
```

Your robot should now be running the latest version.

You can also stop the Valetudo service by running `/etc/init/S11valetudo stop`, and then replace the binary via scp + reboot or restart the service.

Just make sure that you try a full reflash **if you encounter any issues such as "No Map Data" or disappearing settings**.

If you don't have ssh available, you will need to do a full factory reset to re-enable OTA updates on supported robots, and then follow the initial installation procedure.


## Upgrading Dreame vacuums

1. SSH into the vacuum and kill valetudo: `killall valetudo`
2. Replace the old Valetudo binary in `/data/valetudo` with the new one
   - `wget https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/releases/latest/download/valetudo-{armv7,armv7-lowmem,aarch64} -O /data/valetudo`
   - Make sure to use the correct binary as documented in the [supported robots](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) section
   - If you get a "Text file busy" error, it means Valetudo is still running. Try to kill it again.
   - If the issue still occurs, delete the old binary before uploading the new one
3. Reboot your vacuum: `reboot`
